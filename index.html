        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> <!-- Using semantic line breaks - sembr.org -->
            Booklet Web is a relatively lightweight, extensible client for
            <a href="https://blooket.com/">Blooket</a>.
            It aims to use as few bloated JS libraries as possible,
            only pulling in essential Firebase libraries for communication with
            the Blooket realtime database.
            All other functionality is achieved using plain HTML, CSS and JS.
            In contrast, blooket.com pulls in libraries from Google Analytics,
            Stripe (for more analytics), and a variety of smaller sources,
            as well as using React &mdash;
            all leading to a sluggish site, especially on lower-end devices,
            and nearly 8 megabytes of data transfer on first load.<br><br>
            Please note that this website still uses quite a lot of JavaScript;
            if you want a truly bloat-free experience,
            you're out of luck (for now &mdash;
            I have a currently unreleased terminal client
            which I may publish soon!).
